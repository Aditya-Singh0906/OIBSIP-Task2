        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, Bose was a prominent freedom fighter and a key figure in the Indian independence movement. He is best known for his role in forming the Indian National Army (INA) and his leadership in the fight against British rule in India.</p>
        <p>After completing his education in India, Bose went to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services. However, his nationalist fervor led him to abandon his civil service career and return to India in 1921, where he joined the Indian National Congress and worked closely with leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Despite ideological differences with Gandhi, Bose's charismatic leadership and relentless efforts to attain freedom for India earned him immense respect and admiration.</p>
